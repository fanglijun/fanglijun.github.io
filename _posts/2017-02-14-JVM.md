### JVM Architecture

#### Runtime Data Areas

- MethodArea: It stores per-class structures such as the run-time constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors
- Heap: The heap is the run-time data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
- Java Threads: Each Java Virtual Machine thread has a private Java Virtual Machine stack, created at the same time as the thread. A Java Virtual Machine stack stores frames.
    - A new frame is created each time a method is invoked.
    - A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes, whether that completion is normal or abrupt (it throws an uncaught exception).
    - A frame is used to store data and partial results, as well as to perform dynamic linking, return values for methods, and dispatch exceptions.
    - Each frame has its own array of local variables , its own operand stack , and a reference to the run-time constant pool of the class of the current method.
- Program Counter Registers:
    - Each Java Virtual Machine thread has its own pc (program counter) register.
    - At any point, each Java Virtual Machine thread is executing the code of a single method, namely the current method for that thread. If that method is not native, the pc register contains the address of the Java Virtual Machine instruction currently being executed. If the method currently being executed by the thread is native, the value of the Java Virtual Machine's pc register is undefined.
- Native Internal Threads: 非java语言实现的程序运行所占的空间

#### Class loader && Garbage Collection

(图中每画出Stack，因为Stack不需要GC管)

#### Class Loader

The JVM uses different class loaders organized into the following hierarchy:

- The bootstrap class loader is the parent for other class loaders. It loads the core Java libraries and is the only one written in native code.
- The extension class loader is a child of the bootstrap class loader. It loads the extension libraries.
- The system class loader is a child of the extension class loader. It loads the application class files that are found in the classpath.
- A user-defined class loader is a child of the system class loader or another user-defined class loader.

When a class loader receives a request to load a class, it checks the cache to see if the class has already been loaded, then delegates the request to the parent. If the parent fails to load the class, then the child attempts to load the class itself. A child class loader can check the cache of the parent class loader, but the parent cannot see classes loaded by the child. The design is such because a child class loader should not be allowed to load classes that are already loaded by its parent.

#### Execution Engine

The execution engine executes commands from the bytecode loaded into the data areas one by one. To make the bytecode commands readable to the machine, the execution engine uses two methods.

- Interpretation. The execution engine changes each command to machine language as it is encountered.
- Just-in-time (JIT) compilation. If a method is used frequently, the execution engine compiles it to native code and stores it in the cache. After that, all commands associated with this method are executed directly without interpretation.

#### Garbage Collection

When a Java application creates an object, it is stored in the eden pool of the heap. Once it is full, a minor garbage collection is triggered at the eden pool. First, the garbage collector marks dead objects (those that are not referenced by the application any more) and increments the age of live objects (the age is represented by the number of garbage collections that the object has survived). Then the garbage collector discards dead objects and moves live objects to the survivor pool, leaving the eden pool clear.

When a surviving object reaches a certain age, it is moved to the old generation of the heap: the tenured pool. Eventually, the tenured pool fills up and a major garbage collection is triggered to clean it up.

When a garbage collection(minor or major) is performed, all application threads are stopped, causing a pause. Minor garbage collections are frequent, but are optimized to quickly remove dead objects, which are the major part of the young generation. Major garbage collections are much slower because they involve mostly live objects. There are different kinds of garbage collectors, some may be faster in certain situations when performing a major garbage collection.


### heap && stack

#### 示例代码

```java
package com.journaldev.test;

public class Memory {

    public static void main(String[] args) { // Line 1
        int i=1; // Line 2
        Object obj = new Object(); // Line 3
        Memory mem = new Memory(); // Line 4
        mem.foo(obj); // Line 5
    } // Line 9

    private void foo(Object param) { // Line 6
        String str = param.toString(); //// Line 7
        System.out.println(str);
    } // Line 8

}
```

#### 各步骤解释：

1. 方法开始，在Stack里新建一个frame
2. 方法内基本类型的变量放在stack里
3. Object放在Heap里，stack里会保存一个引用
4. Object放在Heap里，stack里会保存一个引用
5. 调用foo方法，在Stack里新建一个frame
6. 同上
7. 字符串放在heap中的String Pool里，stack里放一个引用
8. foo 方法结束，stack里的foo frame被删除
9. main方法结束，stack里的main frame被删除；程序结束，所有内存被释放
